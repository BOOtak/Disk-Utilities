Amiga Disk Utilities
--------------------

A collection of utilities for ripping, dumping, analysing, and modifying Amiga
disk images. All code is public domain (see the COPYING file).

All code except amiga-native/ targets Linux, but should be very POSIX portable.
amiga-native/ targets classic Amiga m68k, tested with SAS/C 6.50.

adfbb/
    Read/modify/write ADF boot blocks. Mainly I use for stuffing bootblock
    sectors and recomputing the checksum.

adfread/
    Read file contents of an ADF and optionally dump into local host filesystem

adfwrite/
    Stuff data into selected sectors of an ADF image

amiga-native/diskread
    Dumps a disk to a (large, 20MB!) file. Really you need an
    Amiga equipped with PCMCIA-CF for this to be useful.

m68k/
  m68k/
    M68k disassembler/emulator library.
  amiga/
    Amiga emulator (very limited, sufficient to run track loaders and
    protection routines).
  disassemble
    Example utility for disassembling raw binary files
  copylock
    Run a given RNC Copylock routine in emulated environment, copying
    decrypted code to a shadow buffer for subsequent disassembly and dump

mfmparse/
  kf2rawdat
    Convert a Kryoflux raw STREAM file to my own fomat (as dumped by Amiga
    tool diskread, above).
  mfmparse2adf
    Converts my raw dump format into an ADF. Of course this assumes that the
    disk image is in ordinary AmigaDOS format.
  mfmparse
    ** WORK IN PROGRESS **
    Analyse my raw dumps for known custom disk formats and convert to a more
    useful and efficient final format.
