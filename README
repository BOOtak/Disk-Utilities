Amiga Disk Utilities
--------------------

A collection of utilities for ripping, dumping, analysing, and modifying Amiga
disk images. All code is public domain (see the COPYING file).

All code except amiga-native/ targets Linux, but should be very POSIX portable.
amiga-native/ targets classic Amiga m68k, tested with SAS/C 6.50.

Building:
---------
    # make

Installing:
-----------
    # make install

Brief Descriptions:
-------------------
libdisk/
    A library for converting and manipulating disk images. It can create
    disk images in an open format from Kryoflux STREAM and SPS/IPF images
    (among others), and then allow these to be accessed and modified.

adfbb/
    Read/modify/write ADF boot blocks. Mainly I use for stuffing bootblock
    sectors and recomputing the checksum.

adfread/
    Read file contents of an ADF and optionally dump into local host filesystem

adfwrite/
    Stuff data into selected sectors of an ADF image

amiga-native/diskread
    Dumps a disk to a (large, 20MB!) file. Really you need an
    Amiga equipped with PCMCIA-CF for this to be useful.

m68k/
  m68k/
    M68k disassembler/emulator library.
  amiga/
    Amiga emulator (very limited, sufficient to run track loaders and
    protection routines).
  disassemble
    Example utility for disassembling raw binary files
  copylock
    Run a given RNC Copylock routine in emulated environment, copying
    decrypted code to a shadow buffer for subsequent disassembly and dump

mfmparse/
    Disk file conversion tool.
    Converts From: Kryoflux STREAM, SPS/IPF, ADF, .DSK,
                   output from Amiga diskread tool.
    Converts To: ADF, .DSK
    Auto-detects and rips disk custom formats into an open container format.
