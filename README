Disk Utilities 
==============

A collection of utilities for ripping, dumping, analysing, and modifying
disk images. All code is public domain (see the COPYING file).

All code except amiga-native/ targets Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
(using Cygwin or MinGW), and should be very POSIX portable.
amiga-native/ targets classic Amiga m68k, tested with SAS/C 6.50.

Prerequisites: You need at least Make and a C compiler (GCC; for Clang you'll
have to edit CC in Rules.mk). On Mac OS X, the Xcode Command Line Tools
include this. On Windows, you need Cygwin/MinGW, Make, and a C compiler.

Building & Installing:
----------------------
    # make clean
    # make
    # sudo make install

IPF & CT Raw support: The CAPS/SPS IPF support library
------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to read IPF and CT Raw images with disk-analyse then you must
explicitly configure support by specifying caps=y in the build process.
    # make clean
    # caps=y make
    # sudo caps=y make install

Your build may now fail with an error similar to
"caps.c:12:28: fatal error: caps/capsimage.h: No such file or directory".
This error occurs if you do not have the CAPS library header file in
/usr/include/caps. In this case you must download and install as follows:
    # wget -O ipflib42_linux-x86_64.tar.gz http://www.softpres.org/_media/files:ipflib42_linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    # tar xf ipflib42_linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    # cd x86_64-linux-gnu-capsimage
    # sudo cp -a include/caps /usr/include

You must also have v4 or v5 of the CAPS library installed (v5 is
required for CT Raw image support). Failure to install the library
will result in an informative error message when you attempt to read a
CTR or IPF image.  You can download, build and install v5 of the
support library as follows:
    # wget http://www.kryoflux.com/download/spsdeclib_5.1_source.zip
    # unzip spsdeclib_5.1_source.zip
    # unzip capsimg_source_linux_macosx.zip
    # cd capsimg_source_linux_macosx/CAPSImg
    # chmod u+x configure
    # ./configure
    # make
    # sudo make install
    # cd /usr/local/lib
    # sudo ln -s libcapsimage.so.5.1 libcapsimage.so.5

Library search path ("error while loading shared libraries: libdisk.so.0"):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that libdisk.so will need to be on the run-time linker's search
path for many of these tools to run. There are a few ways to ensure this:
 1. Use LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X, or PATH on
 Windows. This environment variable specifies a set of paths for the linker
 to search. So, to run disk-analyse without running 'make install', you could
 run it as follows:
    # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libdisk disk-analyse/disk-analyse # Linux
    # DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=libdisk disk-analyse/disk-analyse # Mac OS X
    # PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/libdisk disk-analyse/disk-analyse # Cygwin
 2. Install to a location on the system-wide search path. Unfortunately
 the default install location for libdisk (/usr/local/lib64) on 64-bit
 Linux is often not searched by default. If this is the case on your system,
 you will need to add the path to /etc/ld.so.conf (or to a file in
 /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ in some Linux distros). Then try the following as root:
    # echo "/usr/local/lib64" >>/etc/ld.so.conf
    # ldconfig
 You should now be able to run disk-analyse and other tools just fine.
 
 This should not be necessary on 32-bit Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X.

Brief Descriptions:
-------------------
libdisk/
    A library for converting and manipulating disk images. It can create
    disk images in a range of formats from Kryoflux STREAM and SPS/IPF images
    (among others), and then allow these to be accessed and modified.

adfbb/
    Read/modify/write ADF boot blocks. Mainly I use for stuffing bootblock
    sectors and recomputing the checksum.

adfread/
    Read file contents of an ADF and optionally dump into local host filesystem

adfwrite/
    Stuff data into selected sectors of an ADF image

amiga-native/diskread
    Dumps a disk to a (large, 20MB!) file. Really you need an
    Amiga equipped with PCMCIA-CF for this to be useful.

m68k/
  m68k/
    M68k disassembler/emulator library.
  amiga/
    Amiga emulator (very limited, sufficient to run track loaders and
    protection routines).
  disassemble
    Example utility for disassembling raw binary files
  copylock
    Run a given RNC Copylock routine in emulated environment, copying
    decrypted code to a shadow buffer for subsequent disassembly and dump

disk-analyse/
    Disk file conversion tool.
    Converts From: Kryoflux STREAM, SPS/IPF, ADF, .DSK, .DFI,
                   output from Amiga diskread tool.
    Converts To: ADF, SPS/IPF, .DSK

e-uae-patches/
    A set of patches to fix and improve vanilla E-UAE-0.8.29-WIP4.
    Improvements include disk track counters and save/restore dialogs for
    the GTK-based UI, and support for reading libdisk .DSK images.

    To use these patches, create a plain e-uae-0.8.29-wip4 tree, and then,
    from within the e-uae-patches/ directory:
    # for i in `cat series`; do patch -d xxx -p1 <$i ; done
    where 'xxx' above is the path to your e-uae-0.8.29-wip4 tree!
    You can now configure/build/install e-uae as usual.
